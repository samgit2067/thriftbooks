# ThriftBooks Automation Framework

This project automates UI testing for the **ThriftBooks** website using **Playwright** with the **Page Object Model (POM)** design pattern and **fixtures** for reusable test setup.  

It ensures consistent, maintainable, and scalable test automation for core ThriftBooks functionalities like adding items to the wishlist, searching for books, and verifying cart interactions.

## üß± Fixtures and POM Design

This framework uses **fixtures** to initialize browser context and page objects before each test.  
Fixtures provide a consistent environment for every test case ‚Äî avoiding repetitive code and improving stability.

import { test, expect } from '@playwright/test';
import { LoginPage } from '../pageobjects/login.page';
import { HomePage } from '../pageobjects/home.page';

test('user can log in', async ({ page }) => {
  const login = new LoginPage(page);
  const home = new HomePage(page);

  await login.goto();
  await login.login('user', 'password');
  await home.verifyLoginSuccess();
});

With fixtures, you only define your page objects once ‚Äî and they‚Äôre automatically injected into every test.
This improves readability, reduces duplication, and makes the framework more scalable.
